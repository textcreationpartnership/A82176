            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THis morning his Excellency the Lord Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall <hi>Fairfax,</hi> and Lieutenant General <hi>Crumwell,</hi> randezvouzed with their Horſe and Foot neer <hi>Andover,</hi> where the Lieu. Gen. rode to the head of each Regiment, declaring<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>That He was reſolved to live and aie with them, and that as he had often engaged with them againſt the common Enemy of this Nation, ſo was he reſolved still to perſist therein, againſt thoſe Revolters which are now called by the name of Levellers; not doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but that they would as one man unite, and with una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous ſpirits follow him, for the ſubduing of them, and bringing the chief Ring-leaders thereof to exemplary pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many declared a great willingneſſe to engage with him: Others rejected it, ſaying, they would not fight againſt their friends: But they are now upon their march towards Salisbury, for the reducing and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thoſe Regiments to obedience and ſubjection that have declared againſt them: from whence wee hear, that they are reſolved rather to die, then yeeld to any thing which ſhall infringe their liberty, or pervert the freedom of their Nativity.</p>
            <p>Many of the ſaid party have agreed upon a Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, containing theſe enſuing heads: Firſt, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare againſt the preſent Parl. and their proceedings. 2 Againſt the Councell of State. 3 Againſt the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Councell of the Army. And 4. againſt the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of the late Court of Juſtices Their chief Ring leader is one Capt. Tompſon, who was formerly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by a Councell of War to be hanged, but by the, goodneſſe and compaſſion of the Lord Gen. he was ſpared: this is the man who draws all men after him, his number is conceived to be about 400. and in his
<pb facs="tcp:165115:4"/>watch up and down hee daily gains new Proſelites to him: On Wedneſday laſt he marcht to Coventry where he found reſiſtance, and the Gates ſhut againſt him (demanded if the Gates were ſo holy that he might not enter;) and after the exchange of two or three Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, he left the place, and marched thence to Toſſiter, where coming in very late at night, he ſeized upon ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptain Farmer the Poſt maſter there, who, after they had carryed him as a priſoner up and down with them, they were content to releaſe him upon his Parol to come up to London to the Councel of State, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the releaſe of three of their Brethren, who were taken poſting up of their papers about Banbury; if he could not procure this he was to return as their priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to Banbury.</p>
            <p>Some blows have been already diſputed neer Banbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry between 100 of the Lord Gen. horſe and 200 of the Levellers, and after a ſharp conflict, the Levellers declining engagement, retreated towards Oxford, but no great harm done on either ſide: there is a body of horſe about <hi>Oxford</hi> ready to joyn with them, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by Mr. <hi>Everard,</hi> after uniting, its ſaid they intend Weſtward.</p>
            <p>Some difference hath alſo been in the City of <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter</hi> and the Levellers who had entred the City for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to retreat out again with the loſſe of five men: the Generall and the Lieutenant Generall hath ſent a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Agitators and Commanders in chief of the ſaid party, for preventing of the effuſion of bloud, and healing of the preſent breach, and quenching thoſe flames of Diſcord, which are ready to break forth in ſeverall parts of this Nation; and its hoped a happy &amp; mutuall reconciliation will be embraced, before the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:165115:5"/>involving and ſhedding of any more bloud within the Bowels of this Nation.</p>
